## Setting Up Proper Dependencies

1. Create a directory called software_cs on your PC.
2. If you have not created an SSH key for your device, follow the steps on this page [SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys/) (all the way to end! Last step is to add ssh key to github). First, check for existing keys, then generate new ssh key, then add key to github. Make sure the email you specify is an email you have linked to your github account. 
2. Navigate to this directory in Git Bash/Terminal.
3. Use command `git init` to initialize git repository.
4. Use command `git remote add origin`
